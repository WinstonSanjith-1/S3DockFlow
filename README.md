# s3-flask-app
Tools used: Terraform, docker, jenkins.  

Storage: Amazon s3 bucket.

I have created a devops project which stores any user file uploaded to a web page in Amazon s3 bucket.  
I used Terraform to configure and create a s3 bucket.  
I used python and html to create my webpage application.  
I used Docker to containerize the application.  
Finally I automated the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
